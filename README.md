redact.js
=========

Basically what this does is [this effect](http://http://blokkfont.com/), but
with javascript instead of a font.

I like this on placeholder text. Quite a lot.

To use, just add the class .redacted to any element that contains *only* text.

Oh, and you have to include jQuery (and this script (duh)).
